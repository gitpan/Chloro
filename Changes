[API CHANGE]

- A custom extractor is now expected to return both the value of the field and
  the parameter name(s) associated with the field in the form.

- A repetition_key value for an empty group no longer appears in the result
  value for that the repetition_key's field.

[NEW FEATURES]

- Added several methods:
  Chloro::Group->get_field(),
  Chloro::ResultSet->add_form_error()
  Chloro::ResultSet->secure_raw_params(),
  Chloro::Result::Field->param_names()
  Chloro::Result::Field->add_error()
  Chloro::Error::Field->result()

- Chloro::Error::Field objects now have a weak reference to their associated
  Chloro::Result::Field object, available via $error->result().
